# frontend-crud
Just a little fun exercise I did a while back. :)

This is a simple single page app built with AngularJS that displays a table of household member info, with the ability to add, edit, and remove member info. The data is stored in browser's localStorage.


Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

Run test
```
karma start
```
